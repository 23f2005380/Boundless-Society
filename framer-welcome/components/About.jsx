            We believe in learning that goes beyond textbooks – a journey shaped
            not just by lectures, but by laughter, shared dreams, and unshakable
            friendship.

            Even though our classes are online, what we've built together is{" "}
            <em className="font-semibold">real</em> – connections that cross
            screens and sink deep into our hearts.
          </p>
          <p>
            Because like our adventurous bunny, we{" "}
            <em className="font-semibold">don't</em> just stay in our comfort
            zones – we hop across them.
          </p>
          <p>
            With ears tuned to curiosity and hearts full of wonder, we leap
            beyond the ordinary, explore fearlessly, and chase every horizon
            that calls our name. 🌍🎯

            when you can hop into leadership with charm, cheer, and a little
            chaos – the bunny way!
